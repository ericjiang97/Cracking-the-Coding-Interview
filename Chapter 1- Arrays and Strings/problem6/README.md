# Problem 6
_**String Compression** implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated charactrs. For example the string ``aabcccccaa` would become `a2b1c5a3`.
If the compressed string is not smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a-z)
